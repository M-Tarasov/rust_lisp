MVP:
- Come up with generalized error reporting for function and special-form signatures
- Continue adding basic functions/forms:
  - defun
  - set
  - list comprehension
- expose read/eval to lisp code
- Support multi-statement eval (implicit block)
- More closely adhere to either scheme or common-lisp syntax

Other:
- Handle reference cycles
- Tail recursion
- Better parsing strategy
- Find more concise/efficient way to represent native functions/polymorphism
- Rust macro for FFI
- Macros
- Optional arguments
- Use Nil instead of Option?
- Just use cons cells for native function arguments?
