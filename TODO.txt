- Come up with generalized error reporting for function and special-form signatures
- Handle reference cycles
- Rust macro for FFI
- More closely adhere to either scheme or common-lisp syntax
- Find more concise/efficient way to represent native functions/polymorphism
- Better parsing strategy
- Macros
- Tail recursion
- Use Nil instead of Option?
- Just use cons for native function arguments?
- Optional arguments
- Continue adding basic functions/forms:
  - defun
  - loops
- expose read/eval to lisp code
