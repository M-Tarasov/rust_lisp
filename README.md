# What is this?

**Work in progress**

This is a Lisp interpreter, written in Rust, intended to be embeddable as a 
library in a larger application for scripting purposes. Goals:
- Small footprint (both code size and memory usage)
- Easy, ergonomic interop with native Rust functions
- Small but practical set of Lisp functionality. You shouldn't need to port a
Lisp library for anything basic.
